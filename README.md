- Used the yolov5 pretrained custom model api for detecting if a person is drowsy or awake in realtime
- Used the LabelImg software to label the images
- Used tkinker for making a simple gui app
- Made an alarm system if a person dozes off, audio plays (realtime)
- The accuracy isnt great as i used real time images(some of which were hazy so i guess that might be the cause)
